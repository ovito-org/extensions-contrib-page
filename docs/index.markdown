This page provides a curated directory of useful Python extensions for [OVITO](https://www.ovito.org/), for example, new [modifiers](#modifiers) and [file readers](#file-readers). 
These extensions have been developed and contributed by members of the OVITO user community. They are all hosted in external code repositories, which are 
maintained by their respective authors.

Please see each extension's documentation page or the [OVITO manual](https://ovito.org/docs/dev/reference/pipelines/modifiers/python_script.html#installing-python-based-extensions-for-ovito-with-pip) for installation instructions. Most extensions can be used with *OVITO Pro* and the standalone *OVITO Python Module*
(version 3.9 or later). 

## How to submit your extension
